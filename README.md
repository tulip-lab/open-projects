## :bulb: Content

The purpose of this series of open projects is to help solve a real-world AI project using (but not limited to) modern AI methods. Each project is designed to:
- help you gain hands-on experience in solving real projects;
- item help you get experience in writing academic report.

Accordingly, for your chosen project, you are required to:
-  implement the project as required, and send the `pull request` for the corresponding GitHub repository.
-  develop a report on your method (with adequate justification), 
your discovery, empirical evaluation and analysis.
- deliver and publish (via services such as [YouTube](www.youtube.com)) a 25 minutes demonstration on your project.
