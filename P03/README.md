# Fur-seal face recognition

There are hundreds of photos shot from different islands in Victoria. In this project, you are required to develop a model to do  
- Face Detection
  - detects all the *fur seal* faces from any image containing fur-seals
- Face Recognition
  - determines which faces are from the same fur-seal.
- Behavior informatics
  - With the above two features implemented, you can analyze the group behavior pattern of fur seals using the GPS meta information in the provided photo.

## Data Set

There are more than 30G data for this project, and a small sample data without labels are provided in the following repository [furseal](https://github.com/tulip-lab/furseal):
- https://github.com/tulip-lab/furseal/tree/main/task_datasets 

There are sample codes *transfer learning* using `Yolo` v5 and a labelled data set available at:
-  https://github.com/tulip-lab/furseal/tree/main/datasets


## References 

You can leverage on existing learning models, to fine-tune an existing well established model. Here are some other helpful repositories:
- [Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)
- [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
- [Deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)  
- [DogFaceNet](https://github.com/GuillaumeMougeot/DogFaceNet)  

Your task is to develop the model to detect and recognize fur-seals, and to use the constructed model to make inferences on [`task datasets`](https://github.com/tulip-lab/furseal/tree/main/task_datasets).

It is expected that you will improve the code/algorithms for those two tasks, and develop a running demo to illustrate their functionality. If done appropriately, your model can help answer the following questions:
- How many individual fur-seals in a given set of photos?
- Which fur-seals are often seen on the same beach at the same time (using image meta data)? or for simplification, appear on the same images.
- What is the potential relationship between those co-occurred fur-seals?
