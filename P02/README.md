# Tourism Demand Forecasting 

You are required to design a `Tourism Demand Forecasting` Algorithm,
which will beat existing algorithm in terms of either short term accuracy, long term accuracy by walk-through validation, or *explainability* etc.

There are several open data sets available at: [TULIP Open-Data](https://github.com/tulip-lab/open-data), and all those data come with the publication and source code. For example, the data set [Macau2018](https://github.com/tulip-lab/open-data/tree/master/Macau2018), and one previous implementation is provided at: [DLM](https://github.com/tulip-lab/open-code/tree/master/DLM).
