# Tourism Demand Forecasting Web Service

This project is on the web service implementation of a series of research projects that pioneer the tourism demand forecasting using modern AI approaches. Related implementations and publications:

- https://github.com/tulip-lab/open-code
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160738319300143

The project aims to implement a web service using `ML flow` (or other package, if suitable) to cover the pipeline of `tourism demand forecasting`, including:
- Data Crawling (univariate and multivariate)
- Forecasting model integration, based on released code
- Forecasting model evaluation, walkthrough evaluation based on the latest data, and historical data
- Web service deployment and security configuration
- Online documents and demonstrations

## Keywords:

- Internet of Things, Network Traffic Modelling, Autonomous Vehicles, Machine Learning, Python Programming.
