# Analysis and Design of Decentralized Zero Trust Access Architecture

Real momentum towards a highly distributed workforce has exposed the weaknesses of established perimeter-based security approaches. It has already been noticed that perimeter-based access fail to:
1.	effectively mitigate malicious actors inside the network perimeter, and
2.	offer a sufficient level of protection for users and assets located outside the defined network perimeter (e.g., remote users, devices, services.)

Therefore, robust security models, entirely independent of perimeter and location, are much needed. The Zero Trust Access (ZTA) architecture is a significant departure from perimeter-based security models.  ZTA proposes a radically different approach to network security, in which the infrastructure is always assumed compromised.  The ZTA paradigm shifts security away from implicit trust dependent on a network location. Conversely, it focuses on assessing trust on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

We aim to develop a novel approach for leveraging ZTA's rigorous access control mechanism by using the decentralized computing and analytic capabilities from the distributed ledger and federated learning paradigms. Expected outcomes of such initiatives include a decentralized framework, a distributed policy engine, policy enforcement design, and new strategies for information leakage prevention in corporate networks. It should provide significant benefits to organizational network security and enable advances towards federated environment for trusted and secure remote working and collaboration. Assumptions and designs have to be evaluated with preliminary results. Typical tasks could be:

- Investigating continuous authentication and authorization mechanisms for decentralized ZTA; 
- Designing an intelligent decentralized framework for the efficient enforcement of ZTA policies
